# Video Store

We have envisioned a universe where streaming services yet do not exist. In this universe, we have a video store that allows users to rent movies, and its admins to manage the store.

## Usage

To run the project, run `schema.sql` to create the database and feel free to use our `populating_schema.sql` to populate the database with some data. Make sure to update `db_connect.php` with your database credentials.

To run the project, put our php source code in `src` folder in your web server's root directory. You can use XAMPP or WAMP for this. Optionally add the `styles` folder for a more appealing look.
